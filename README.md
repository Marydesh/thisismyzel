# MY FIRST WEB DEVELOPER PORTFOLIO

This is the first web developer portfolio I built and am proud of myself, but there is so much more to learn and work on ahead!

* I tried building this page mobile-first responsive, for the users to be able to access it with a mobile device.

 To accomplish this, I created the CSS parameters for a mobile devices first and then used media styles to adjust the responivness for a different screen sizes including desktop.

 * I also used a pseudo classes to create a hover effect on links.

 * For inspiration I used:

 # "Teach yourself visually HTML and CSS" book by Guy Hart-Davis
 # Youtube page https://www.youtube.com/@LearnDesignTutorial
 # MDN and multiple documentation resources.
 # https://www.shecodes.io/ website

 Thnak you for reviewing this!
